# New York Civilian Complaint Review Bord data

Refers to 3 sources of CCRB data:


- from the CCRB's ["Data Transparency Initiative"](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/ccrb/policy/data-transparency-initiative-complaints.page), which covers "all complaints and allegations closed" from 2006 to 2016 
    - [direct link to spreadsheet](http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/ccrb/downloads/excel/ccrb_datatransparencyinitiative_20170207.xlsx)
- From the city's Socrata Open Data site, which has fewer fields than the Data Transparency Initiative, but also a few more years of data:
    - [Complaints received](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Civilian-Complaint-Review-Board-CCRB-Complaints-Re/63nx-cpi9)
    - [Complaints closed](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Civilian-Complaint-Review-Board-CCRB-Complaints-Cl/fx4z-5xg2)
    - [Allegations closed](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Civilian-Complaint-Review-Board-CCRB-Allegations-C/xyq2-jjkn)
- From [ProPublica's Data Store, which consists of complaints against NYPD officers](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/civilian-complaints-against-new-york-city-police-officers) for which the officer is active and has at least one substantiated complaint (the terms of service do not allow for that data to be included in the repo)
